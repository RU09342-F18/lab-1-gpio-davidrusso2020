OVERVIEW
--------

The Button Blink is a program that blinks two LEDs indefinitely, one when a button is pressed and another when it is not pressed.

The Simple Blink is implemented on two different development boards:
1. MSP430G2553
2. MSP432P401R

First, the general design of the implementation will be discussed. Then, the specific implementations on each board are discussed.

GENERAL DESIGN
--------------

In order to execute this program:
- certain pins on each processor are routed to LEDs and certain pins to buttons on the development board
- the pins of interest need to be configured as GPIO
- the direction of the pins routed to LEDs need to be configured as outputs
- the direction of the pin routed to a button needs to be configured as an input
- pull up resistors need to be enabled on the output to ensure the circuit does not float when the button is not pressed
- the output of the pins need to be preset to a certain value
- in an infinite loop, an if statement determines which LED is off and which one toggles based on the state of the button

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP430G2553 IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------

- P1.0 and P2.0 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- P1.3 is the pin tied to a button
- P1SEL is set to 0, allocating all 8-bits of port 1 as GPIO
- Bits 0 and 6 of P1DIR are set high, configuring P1.0 and P1.6 as outputs
- Bit 3 of P1DIR is set low, configuring P1.3 as an input
- Bit 3 of P1REN is set high, enabling a resistor at P1.3
- Bits 0 and 6 of P1OUT are set high, presetting P1.0 and P1.6 high 
- Bit 3 of P1OUT is set high, configuring the resistor as a pull-up resistor
- in an infinant loop, an if statement is used to check if the button is pressed or not, toggling each LED as necessary

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP432P401R IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------

- P2.0 and P2.2 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- P1.1 is the pin tied to a button
- Bits 1 and 2 of both P2SEL0 and P2SEL1 are set to 0, allocating P2.1 and P2.2 as GPIO
- Bit 1 of both P1SEL0 and P2SEL1 is set to 0, allocating P1.1 as GPIO
- Bits 1 and 2 of P2DIR are set high, configuring P2.1 and P2.2 as outputs
- Bit 1 of P1DIR is set low, configuring P1.1 as an input
- Bit 3 of both P1REN and P1OUT is set high, enabling a pull-up resistor at P1.3
- Bits 1 and 2 of P2OUT are set high, presetting P2.1 and P2.2 high 
- in an infinant loop, an if statement is used to check if the button is pressed or not, toggling each LED as necessary
