OVERVIEW
--------

The Multiple Blink is a program that blinks two LEDs asychronously and indefinitely.

The Mulitple Blink program is implemented on two different development boards:
1. MSP430G2553
2. MSP430FR2311

First, the general design of the implementation will be discussed. Then, the specific implementations on each board are discussed.

GENERAL DESIGN
--------------

In order to execute this program:
- the certain pins on each processor are routed to LEDs on the development board
- the pins of interest need to be configured as GPIO
- the direction of the pins need to be configured as outputs
- the output of the pins need to be preset to a certain value
- in an infinite loop, the pins need to toggle states each with a different delay

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP430G2553 IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------

- P1.0 and P1.6 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- P1SEL is set to 0, allocating all 8-bits of port 1 as GPIO
- Bits 0 and 6 of P1DIR are set high, configuring P1.0 and P1.6 as outputs
- using a for-loop, counter i is incremented and modulus arithmetic is used to delay the toggling at different invervals

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP430FR2311 IMPLEMENTATION
---------------------------

- PM5CTL0 &= ~LOCKLPM5; is necessary to unlock the ports to allow for GPIO interface
- P1.0 and P2.0 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- Bit 0 of both P1SEL0 and P1SEL1 is set low, allocating P1.0 as GPIO
- Bit 0 of both P2SEL0 and P2SEL1 is set low, allocating P2.0 as GPIO
- Bit 0 of both P1DIR and P2DIR are set high, configuring P1.0 and P2.0 as outputs
- Two counter integers are declared outside the infinite loop to keep track of the different delays
