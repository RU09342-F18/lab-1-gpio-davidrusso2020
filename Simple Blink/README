OVERVIEW
--------

The Simple Blink is a program that blinks two LEDs syncronously and indefinitely.

The Simple Blink is implemented on two different development boards:
1. MSP430G2553
2. MSP420F5529

First, the general design of the implementation will be discussed. Then, the specific implementations on each board are discussed.


***************************************************************************************************************************************
GENERAL DESIGN
--------------

In order to execute this program:
- the certain pins on each processor are routed to LEDs on the development board
- the pins of interest need to be configured as GPIO
- the direction of the pins need to be configured as outputs
- the output of the pins need to be preset to a certain value
- in an infinite loop, the pins need to toggle states with a delay

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP430G2553 IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------

- P1.0 and P1.6 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- P1SEL is set to 0, allocating all 8-bits of port 1 as GPIO
- Bits 0 and 6 of P1DIR are set high, configuring P1.0 and P1.6 as outputs

***************************************************************************************************************************************
MSP430F5529 IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------

- P1.0 and P2.7 are the pins tied to the LEDs on the development board
- P1SEL and P2SEL are set to 0, allocating all 8-bits of port 1 and port 2 as GPIO
- Bit 0 of P1DIR and bit 7 of P2DIR are set high, configuring P1.0 and P2.7 as outputs
