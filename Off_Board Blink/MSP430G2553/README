OVERVIEW
--------

The Off-Board Blink uses the Multiple Blink code on the MSP430G2553 and is placed in a breadboard to light up LEDs

First, the MSP430G2553 Pinout is shown. Then, the circuit design is discussed.

MSP430G2553 PINOUT FOR PINS USED
--------------------------------

| Pin No. | Port | Description        |
|         |      |                    |
| 1       | NA   | Vcc                |
| 2       | P1.0 | Feeds to Green LED |
| 14      | P1.6 | Feeds to Red LED   |
| 16      | ~RST | Feeds to Button    |
| 20      | NA   | Vss                |

CIRCUIT DESIGN
--------------

In order to execute this program:
- pin 1 is tied to Vcc (3.3 V), pin 20 is tied to Vss (0 V)
- pin 2 connects to a green LED through a 220 Ohm resistor. The green LED is connected to Ground
- pin 14 connects to a red LED through a 220 Ohm resistor. The red LED is connected to Ground
- pin 16 is connected to a button, which is connected to ground
- to account for floating, a 50 kOhm resistor pulls up from pin 14 to Vcc (3.3 V) and a .022 uF capacitor is placed in parallel
- note: the code must be programmed onto the MSP430G2553 IC before it is placed into the breadboard
